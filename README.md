# Simple Makrukthai AI

This repository contains a simple makrukthai AI that utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal performance. The AI evaluates board positions using piece-square tables to make the best move.

## Features

- Makrukthai AI with Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning
- Board evaluation using piece-square tables
- Compatible with the `chess.js` library
- Integration with the `chessboard.js` library for visual representation in `index.html`

## Demo

A simple demo can be found in the index.html file. Open the file in your browser to see the AI in action.
